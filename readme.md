# 3D Map Project for De Florijn, Amsterdam

## Project Overview
This project was undertaken for the Florijn residence in the Bijlmer area of Amsterdam, as a part of the PAD course. Initially started by a team of five, which later downsized to two members, we successfully developed a Single Page Application (SPA) using the PAD framework provided by our school.

## Key Features
- **ThreeJS Integration**: We utilized ThreeJS to render a 3D map of the Florijn residence area. On this map, we placed interactive spheres, or text sprites, representing different stories from various locations in the building. Each sphere is annotated with the number of stories related to that particular spot.
- **SPA Structure**: The application is designed as a Single Page Application, providing a seamless user experience.
- **MVC Architecture**: We followed the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern in the frontend development to ensure a clean, maintainable code structure.
- **Technologies Used**: The project is built using Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and ThreeJS for the frontend. The backend is powered by MySQL, Node.js, and Express.
- **Backend Development**: Our team was responsible for creating backend routes, which involved handling data management and server-side logic.
- **Frontend Development**: We designed and developed frontend pages, ensuring they were responsive and user-friendly.
- **Testing**: We conducted frontend testing using Cypress to ensure the reliability and functionality of the application.

## Project Challenges and Successes
- **Team Dynamics**: Navigating the challenges of a reduced team size, we effectively managed to distribute tasks and collaborate efficiently to meet our project goals.
- **Technical Implementation**: The integration of ThreeJS for 3D visualization and the creation of an SPA using the PAD framework were significant technical achievements.
- **Learning Outcomes**: This project was an excellent opportunity to apply our skills in full-stack development, from database management with MySQL to frontend development with modern web technologies and 3D graphics with ThreeJS.
